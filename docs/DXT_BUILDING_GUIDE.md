# DXT Extension Building - Complete Guide for MCP Servers

**Version:** 3.1.0
**Date:** 2025-01-24
**Applies to:** ALL MCP server repositories
**AI Tools:** Windsurf, Cursor, Claude Code  

## 🌟 What is DXT?

DXT (Deployment eXtension Toolkit) is a powerful framework developed by Anthropic specifically for packaging and distributing MCP (Model Control Protocol) servers. It provides a standardized way to package, version, and deploy MCP server implementations with all their dependencies.

### Key Components of DXT

1. **DXT CLI**: Command-line interface for managing the DXT packaging and deployment lifecycle
2. **DXT Runtime**: Execution environment for MCP servers
3. **DXT Registry**: Central repository for versioned MCP server packages
4. **DXT SDK**: Tools and libraries for MCP server development

## 🏗️ DXT Manifest (dxt_manifest.json)

The `dxt_manifest.json` file is the heart of any MCP server package. It defines the server's metadata, configuration, dependencies, and runtime requirements.

### Manifest Creation Methods

#### 1. Manual Creation (Not Recommended)

```bash
dxt init  # Creates a basic manifest (not recommended for production)
```

This method creates a minimal `dxt_manifest.json` that requires manual updates. It's only suitable for quick testing.

#### 2. AI-Powered Generation (Recommended)

The preferred method is to use AI-powered tools that analyze your repository and generate a comprehensive manifest:

```bash
# Using Windsurf AI (recommended)
windsurf dxt analyze --path ./src --output dxt_manifest.json

# Or using the DXT CLI with AI enhancement
dxt analyze --ai --output dxt_manifest.json
```

These tools will:
- Analyze your codebase structure
- Detect entry points and dependencies
- Generate appropriate configuration
- Create proper API bindings
- Set up required permissions

### Key Manifest Sections

```json
{
  "name": "your-extension",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Your extension description",
  "main": "dist/main.js",
  "docker": {
    "image": "your-org/your-image:tag",
    "ports": ["8080"]
  },
  "ui": {
    "dashboard-tab": "./ui/dashboard.html"
  },
  "permissions": [
    "containers:read",
    "images:list"
  ]
}
```

## 🤖 Prompt Templates in DXT

Prompt templates are JSON files that define how AI models should interact with your extension. They're crucial for creating consistent and effective AI-driven features.

### Template Structure

```json
{
  "name": "container-inspection",
  "description": "Inspects a container and provides detailed analysis",
  "parameters": {
    "container_id": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "ID of the container to inspect"
    }
  },
  "prompt": "Analyze the container with ID {{container_id}}. Check its status, resources, and potential issues.",
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": {"container_id": "abc123"},
      "output": "Container abc123 is running with 2 CPUs and 4GB memory..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Automatic Template Generation

DXT can generate prompt templates by analyzing your code and documentation:

```bash
# Generate prompt templates from code analysis
dxt generate-prompts --source ./src --output ./prompts

# Or use AI to enhance existing prompts
dxt enhance-prompts --input ./prompts --output ./enhanced-prompts
```

### Prompt Template Features

1. **Variables**: Use `{{variable}}` syntax for dynamic content
2. **Validation**: Automatic parameter validation
3. **Versioning**: Track changes to prompts over time
4. **Localization**: Support for multiple languages
5. **Testing**: Built-in testing framework for prompts

## 🏭 DXT Standards and Governance

DXT is developed and maintained by Anthropic with contributions from the open-source community. The project follows semantic versioning and has a well-defined RFC process for major changes.

### Key Standards

1. **Extension Packaging**: OCI-compliant containers
2. **API Design**: RESTful principles with OpenAPI specifications
3. **Security**: OAuth 2.0 and mTLS for authentication
4. **UI/UX**: Follows Docker Design System
5. **Logging**: Structured logging in JSON format

### Versioning

- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: New features (backward compatible)
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and improvements

## 🎯 CRITICAL RULES - READ FIRST

### ❌ NEVER DO

1. **NO `dxt init`** - Outdated and creates minimal configurations
2. **NO manual configuration** - Use proper `dxt.json` with all required fields
3. **NO custom build scripts** - Use standard DXT tooling only
4. **NO hardcoded paths** - Use relative paths in configuration
5. **NO direct server execution** - Always use DXT CLI tools

### ✅ ALWAYS DO

1. **Use `dxt.json`** - Central configuration file for all DXT settings
2. **Follow semantic versioning** - For both package and MCP versions
3. **Use stdio transport** - Required for reliable communication
4. **Specify exact versions** - For all dependencies
5. **Validate before building** - Always run `dxt validate` first
6. **Verify after building** - Always run `dxt verify` after packaging
7. **Sign production packages** - Use `dxt sign` for production releases
8. **Use the build script** - For consistent builds across environments

## 🖥️ DXT CLI COMMAND SYNTAX

### Core Commands

#### 1. Package Creation

```bash
# Basic package creation
dxt pack . dist/

# Sign the package (required for production)
dxt sign --key your-key.pem dist/package.dxt

# Verify package integrity
dxt verify --key your-key.pem dist/package.dxt

# Publish to a DXT registry (if configured)
dxt publish --registry your-registry dist/package.dxt
```

#### 2. DXT Registries

DXT registries are package repositories that store and distribute DXT packages. Here's what you need to know:

##### Official Registries

- **Anthropic's Public Registry**: The primary public registry for production DXT packages
  - URL: `https://registry.dxt.anthropic.com` (requires authentication)
  - Managed by Anthropic
  - Requires review and approval for public packages

##### Self-hosted Registries

- **Enterprise/Private Registries**: Some organizations run private DXT registries
  - Configure via environment variable: `DXT_REGISTRY_URL`
  - Authentication typically required via API keys or tokens

##### Key Points

- **Authentication**: Always required for publishing

  ```bash
  export DXT_API_TOKEN='your-token-here'
  ```

- **Scoped Packages**: Use `@scope/package-name` for organization-specific packages
- **Rate Limits**: Public registry has rate limits for downloads/uploads
- **Verification**: All packages are cryptographically signed

#### 3. Build Script (Recommended)

For consistent builds, use the provided PowerShell build script:

```powershell
# Show help and available options
.\scripts\build-mcp-package.ps1 -Help

# Build and sign the package (default behavior)
.\scripts\build-mcp-package.ps1

# Build without signing (for development/testing)
.\scripts\build-mcp-package.ps1 -NoSign

# Specify custom output directory
.\scripts\build-mcp-package.ps1 -OutputDir "C:\builds"
```

```

### Common Options

- `--verbose` or `-v`: Enable verbose output
- `--help` or `-h`: Show help message
- `--version` or `-V`: Show version information

### Environment Variables

- `DXT_DEBUG=1`: Enable debug mode
- `DXT_LOG_LEVEL=debug`: Set log level (debug, info, warn, error)

### Important Notes

1. Always run from the project root directory
2. The `dxt init` command is deprecated - do not use it
3. For production builds, always validate before packaging
4. Sign packages for distribution when sharing with others

## 📋 DXT.JSON VS MANIFEST.JSON

### Key Differences

| File | Purpose | When Used | Example Use Case |
|------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| `dxt.json` | Development/build configuration | During development and build process | Configure build output directory, development server settings |
| `manifest.json` | Runtime configuration | When the extension is running | Define server entry points, capabilities, and extension metadata |

### dxt.json (Build Configuration)

Used by the DXT CLI tools during development and build. Defines how to build and package your extension.

### manifest.json (Runtime Configuration)

Packaged with your extension and used by the DXT runtime. Defines how your extension should be loaded and executed.

## 📋 DXT.JSON CONFIGURATION

### Required Fields

```json
{
  "name": "your-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Brief description of your MCP server",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "license": "MIT",
  "outputDir": "dist",
  "mcp": {
    "version": "2.12.0",
    "server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "your.package.module"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    },
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": true,
      "resources": true,
      "prompts": true
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "python": ">=3.9.0"
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ BUILDING THE PACKAGE

### 1. Validate Configuration

```bash
dxt validate
```

### 2. Build the Package

```bash
dxt pack
```

This will create the package in the `dist` directory.

### 3. Package Signing (Not Currently Used)

```bash
dxt sign package.dxt
```

Package signing is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of DXT packages. However, we currently do not use package signing in our workflow. If needed in the future, signing can be enabled by:

1. Generating a signing key pair
2. Configuring the build process to sign packages
3. Distributing the public key to all clients

For now, you can safely ignore any signing-related steps in the DXT documentation.

## 📜 MANIFEST.JSON - CORE CONFIGURATION

### Purpose

`manifest.json` is the primary configuration file that defines your DXT extension's behavior, dependencies, and capabilities. It's crucial for the DXT runtime to understand how to load and execute your extension.

### Required Fields

```json
{
  "dxt_version": "0.1",
  "name": "your-extension-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Brief description of your extension",
  "author": "Your Name <email@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "src/your_package/server.py"
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": true,
    "resources": true,
    "prompts": true
  }
}
```

### Key Sections Explained

1. **Server Configuration**
   - `type`: Must be "python" for Python-based extensions
   - `entry_point`: Path to your main server file

2. **Capabilities**
   - `tools`: Enable/disable tool support
   - `resources`: Enable/disable resource handling
   - `prompts`: Enable/disable prompt templates

### Best Practices

- Keep `manifest.json` in the root of your project
- Use semantic versioning for the `version` field
- Include all required fields
- Validate using `dxt validate` before building

## ⚙️ SERVER CONFIGURATION

### FastMCP Server Best Practices

- Use FastMCP 2.12.0 or later
- Implement proper signal handling
- Use structured logging
- Handle all exceptions gracefully

### Dependency Management

- List all dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Pin exact versions for production
- Use virtual environments

## 📦 PACKAGE MANIFEST

### Manifest Fields

```json
{
  "dxt_version": "0.1",
  "name": "your-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Brief description for extension store",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "you@example.com"
  },
  "server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "src/your_mcp/server.py",
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "your_mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "src",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "src",
        "EXTERNAL_TOOL": "${user_config.external_tool}",
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 🚨 CRITICAL PYTHON PATH FIX

**Problem**: DXT extensions fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` because Python module path resolution is incorrect.

**Root Cause**: DXT runner executes from extension root, but Python modules are in `src/` subdirectory.

**Solution**: ALWAYS include these fields in Python-based DXT manifests. 

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT use `cwd` in `mcp_config` as it will cause validation to fail. Instead, ensure your Python path is set correctly using `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

```json
{
  "server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "your_mcp/server.py",
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "your_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": ".",  // ⭐ CRITICAL: Use "." to reference the package root (where manifest.json is located)
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**File Structure that requires this fix:**

```
your-extension.dxt/
├── manifest.json
├── requirements.txt
├── your_mcp/                      // ⭐ Python package at root level
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── server.py                  // Entry point
│   └── ...
└── assets/                        // Static assets
```

## 📝 PROMPTS CONFIGURATION

### Prompt Files Structure

DXT supports three types of prompt files that should be placed in a `dxt/prompts/` directory:

```
your-extension.dxt/
├── dxt/prompts/
│   ├── system.md     # System prompt (required)
│   ├── user.md       # User prompt template (required)
│   └── examples.json # Example interactions (optional)
└── ...
```

### 1. System Prompt (`system.md`)

- Defines the AI's role and capabilities
- Should include:
  - Core functionality description
  - Available tools and their purposes
  - Response format guidelines
  - Safety and security constraints

### 2. User Prompt (`user.md`)

- Template for user interactions
- Can include placeholders for dynamic content
- Should be clear and concise

### 3. Examples (`examples.json`)

- Optional but highly recommended
- Provides example interactions
- Helps the AI understand expected behavior
- Format:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "input": "user query or command",
      "output": "expected AI response"
    }
  ]
  ```

### Referencing Prompts in manifest.json

Add a `prompts` section to your manifest.json:

```json
{
  "name": "your-mcp-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "prompts": {
    "system": "dxt/prompts/system.md",
    "user": "dxt/prompts/user.md",
    "examples": "dxt/prompts/examples.json"
  },
  "server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "src/your_mcp/server.py"
  }
}
```

### Best Practices for Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the AI's capabilities and limitations
2. **Use Markdown**: Format prompts with headers, lists, and code blocks
3. **Version Control**: Track prompt changes in version control
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate prompts with various inputs
5. **Keep Secure**: Don't include sensitive information in prompts
6. **Document Assumptions**: Note any assumptions about the environment or user knowledge

### User Config Patterns

#### External Executable

```json
"user_config": {
  "external_tool": {
    "type": "file",
    "title": "External Tool Executable",
    "description": "Select your tool installation (tool.exe on Windows, tool on macOS/Linux)",
    "required": true,
    "default": "C:\\Program Files\\Tool\\tool.exe",
    "filter": [".exe"],
    "validation": {
      "must_exist": true,
      "executable": true
    }
  }
}
```

#### Directory Selection

## 🚨 CLAUDE DESKTOP EXTENSION PATH BUGS

### Critical Bug: Incorrect Extension Path Resolution

**Symptoms:**

```
python.exe: can't open file 'C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\AnthropicClaude\\app-{version}\\server\\main.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
[Extension Name] [error] Server disconnected
```

**Root Cause:**
Claude Desktop has a path resolution bug where it tries to execute extensions from the wrong directory:

- **Incorrect (what Claude Desktop tries):** `C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\AnthropicClaude\app-{version}\server\main.py`
- **Correct (actual location):** `C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\Claude\Claude Extensions\local.dxt.{publisher}.{name}\server\main.py`

### 🔧 WORKAROUND STRATEGIES

#### Strategy 1: Manual Configuration Entry (Immediate Fix)

When an extension fails with path errors, add a manual entry to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-extension-manual": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{extension-name}/server/main.py"],
      "cwd": "C:/Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{extension-name}",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:/Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{extension-name}/server;C:/Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{extension-name}/server/lib",
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        "EXTENSION_DEBUG": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Steps:**

1. Backup your config: `Copy-Item "$env:APPDATA\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json" "C:\temp\claude_config_backup.json"`
2. Find your extension's actual path in: `%APPDATA%\Claude\Claude Extensions\`
3. Add manual entry with correct paths
4. Restart Claude Desktop
5. Disable the broken extension to avoid conflicts

#### Strategy 2: Prevention in DXT Manifest Design

Update your `manifest.json` to be more robust against path resolution bugs:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "server/main.py",
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["${__dirname}/server/main.py"],
      "cwd": "${__dirname}",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${__dirname}/server;${__dirname}/server/lib;${__dirname}",
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        "EXTENSION_ROOT": "${__dirname}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Prevention Elements:**

- Use `${__dirname}` template literals for all paths
- Include comprehensive PYTHONPATH with fallbacks
- Add extension root environment variable for runtime detection
- Use relative paths in entry_point when possible

#### Strategy 3: User Documentation Template

Include this troubleshooting section in your extension's README.md:

```markdown
## 🚨 Troubleshooting Installation

### Extension Fails to Start ("Server disconnected")

**Symptoms:** Extension shows as failed in Claude Desktop settings.

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check logs: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-{ExtensionName}.log`
2. Look for errors like: `can't open file 'C:\\Users\\...\\app-{version}\\server\\main.py'`
3. This indicates a Claude Desktop path resolution bug

**Fix:** Apply manual configuration workaround:

1. **Backup your config:**
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item "$env:APPDATA\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json" "$env:TEMP\claude_config_backup.json"
   ```

2. **Find your extension path:**

   ```powershell
   Get-ChildItem "$env:APPDATA\Claude\Claude Extensions" | Where-Object Name -like "*{your-extension-name}*"
   ```

3. **Add manual entry to `claude_desktop_config.json`:**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "{your-extension-name}-manual": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": ["C:/Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{extension-name}/server/main.py"],
         "cwd": "C:/Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{extension-name}",
         "env": {
           "PYTHONPATH": "C:/Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{extension-name}/server",
           "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop**

5. **Disable the broken extension** to avoid conflicts

This workaround bypasses the Claude Desktop path resolution bug.

```

### 🔍 DEBUGGING EXTENSION PATH ISSUES

#### Log Analysis

**Primary log location:**
```

%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-{ExtensionName}.log

```

**Error patterns to look for:**
```

can't open file 'C:\\Users\\...\\app-{version}\\server\\main.py'
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'your_extension'
Server disconnected unexpectedly

```

#### PowerShell Diagnostic Script

```powershell
# Quick extension path diagnostic
$extensionName = "your-extension-name"
$username = $env:USERNAME
$appDataPath = $env:APPDATA

# Check if extension is installed
$extensionPath = Get-ChildItem "$appDataPath\Claude\Claude Extensions" | Where-Object Name -like "*$extensionName*"
if ($extensionPath) {
    Write-Host "✅ Extension found: $($extensionPath.FullName)"
    
    # Check for main.py
    $mainPy = Join-Path $extensionPath.FullName "server\main.py"
    if (Test-Path $mainPy) {
        Write-Host "✅ Main script found: $mainPy"
    } else {
        Write-Host "❌ Main script NOT found: $mainPy"
    }
    
    # Check logs
    $logPath = "$appDataPath\Claude\logs\mcp-server-$extensionName.log"
    if (Test-Path $logPath) {
        Write-Host "📋 Recent log entries:"
        Get-Content $logPath -Tail 10
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "❌ Extension not found in: $appDataPath\Claude\Claude Extensions"
}
```

## 🚧 TROUBLESHOOTING DXT EXTENSIONS

### Common Python Module Issues

#### Problem: ModuleNotFoundError

```
python.exe: Error while finding module specification for 'your_mcp.server' 
(ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'your_mcp')
[your-mcp] [error] Server disconnected
```

#### Solution: Verify Python Path Configuration

Check manifest.json has correct paths:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "your_mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "src",                    // ⭐ Must point to module directory
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "src",           // ⭐ Must include module directory
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Manual MCP Configuration Fallback

If DXT fails, configure manually in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-mcp-server": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "your_mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "C:/Users/{user}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{name}/src",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "C:/Users/{user}/AppData/Roaming/Claude/Claude Extensions/local.dxt.{publisher}.{name}/src",
        "PYTHONUNBUFFERED": "1",
        "YOUR_CONFIG": "your_value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### FastMCP Version Issues

#### Problem: Incompatible FastMCP Version

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'FastMCP' from 'fastmcp'
AttributeError: 'FastMCP' object has no attribute 'some_method'
```

#### Solution: Update to FastMCP 2.12.0+

```bash
# Uninstall old version
pip uninstall fastmcp

# Install exact version
pip install "fastmcp>=2.12.0,<3.0.0"

# Verify installation
python -c "import fastmcp; print(fastmcp.__version__)"
```

#### Update requirements.txt

```txt
# CRITICAL: Use exact version constraints
fastmcp>=2.12.0,<3.0.0
fastapi>=0.95.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.22.0
pydantic>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

## 🔧 VALIDATION RULES

### Manifest Validation

```bash
# Always validate before building
dxt validate dxt/manifest.json

# Common issues:
# - Missing cwd and PYTHONPATH for Python servers
# - fastmcp version < 2.12.0 in dependencies
# - Invalid template literal syntax
# - Incorrect user_config types
```

### Python Environment Validation

```bash
# Test Python module import manually
cd src
python -c "import your_mcp.server; print('✅ Module imports successfully')"

# Test FastMCP version
python -c "import fastmcp; print(f'FastMCP version: {fastmcp.__version__}')"

# Verify >= 2.12.0
python -c "import fastmcp; assert fastmcp.__version__ >= '2.12.0', 'Update FastMCP!'"
```

### DXT Package Testing

```bash
# Build test package
cd dxt
dxt pack . ../package.dxt

# Install test package in Claude Desktop
# Verify configuration prompts work
# Test extension functionality
# Check logs for errors
```

## 🆕 WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 2.1

### Critical Bug Documentation

1. **Claude Desktop Extension Path Bug**: Comprehensive troubleshooting for path resolution failures
2. **Manual Config Workarounds**: Three strategies to bypass extension path bugs
3. **Prevention Techniques**: DXT manifest patterns to reduce bug impact
4. **User Documentation Templates**: Ready-to-use troubleshooting guides
5. **Diagnostic Tools**: PowerShell scripts for quick path issue detection

### Updated Checklists

- Added manual config fallback planning to pre-development
- Enhanced post-release monitoring for path resolution issues
- Integrated extension bug reporting into maintenance workflows

## 🆕 WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 2.0

### Critical Updates

1. **FastMCP 2.12.0 Requirement**: Mandatory for DXT compatibility
2. **Python Path Fix**: Explicit `cwd` and `PYTHONPATH` configuration
3. **Updated Examples**: All examples include new requirements
4. **Enhanced Troubleshooting**: Manual MCP fallback procedures
5. **CI/CD Updates**: GitHub Actions with correct dependency installation

### Breaking Changes

- **FastMCP < 2.12.0 no longer supported** in DXT extensions
- **Python servers require explicit path configuration** in manifest
- **All existing DXT packages need rebuilding** with new requirements

### Migration Guide

1. Update `requirements.txt`: `fastmcp>=2.12.0,<3.0.0`
2. Add to manifest `mcp_config`: `"PYTHONPATH": "."` (Note: cwd not supported by mcpb)
3. Rebuild DXT package: `dxt pack . ../dist/updated-package.dxt`
4. Test installation and fallback to manual MCP if needed

This guide provides everything needed to build professional DXT extensions that work reliably across all platforms and installations with the latest FastMCP improvements and Python path fixes. Follow these patterns for consistent, high-quality MCP server packaging that actually works in production.
